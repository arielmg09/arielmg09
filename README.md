### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Who Am I

> I'm an experienced economist with 5+ years of experience in quantitative finance and macroecnomic research :chart_with_upwards_trend:  
> I joined the sector in 2015, working as a model validation of credit risk models. I am located in London, as part of highly skilled quantitative analyst team working for a top tier European bank :bowtie:. 

A little more about my **recent experience**:
- The methodologies I reviewed as a model validator comprised logistic regression, transition models, and variable selection process using `Python`
- The activities involved the assessment of the methodology and performance of the model, assumptions testing, sensitivity analysis and input data review
- I performed validation of commodities hedge fund operating revenue projection model, using time series modelling in `R` language. The assessment involved stress testing projections for *FED CCAR* scenarios
- Performed independent validation of Operational Risk day-to-day losses projections, using Poisson regressions and `R` language to test model soundness, sensitivity and performance
- Performed an independent validation of secured funding liquidity risk under stress scenarios as per *CCAR/DFAST* guidelines and the model governance framework.


A little more about my **profile**:
* Strong expertise in model risk (including *SR 11-7*, *OCC 2011-12*), stress testing (*CCAR/DFAST*), and *PPNR* forecasting
* Deep knowledge of statistics and econometrics
* Strong ability to collaborate with various stakeholders across the business and explain technical concepts to senior management.

I enjoy learning programming languages that helps me to improve my dayly work and increase my productivity , such as:
* `R`
* `Python`
* `SAS`
* `Matlab`
* `SQL`
